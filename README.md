[Bunnos](https://olartbaraq.github.io/Bunnos_marketplace/) is a web application that is designed for buying and selling of rabbits exclusively. Bunnos is specifically designed for rabbit enthusiasts with features to fit the buyer and seller transaction process. To achieve this goal, Bunnos provides a unique user system that makes a guest(not registered user) interact with the web application to purchase rabbit without signing up. Registered users can post ads, transact using the escrow service and view feedbacks on their ads.
