[Bunnos](https://olartbaraq.github.io/Bunnos_marketplace/) is a web application that is designed for buying and selling of rabbits exclusively. Bunnos is specifically designed for rabbit enthusiasts with features to fit the buyer and seller transaction process. To achieve this goal, Bunnos provides a unique user system that makes a guest(not registered user) interact with the web application to purchase rabbit without signing up. Registered users can post ads, transact using the escrow service and view feedbacks on their ads.

<h2>The Story</h2>

While Bunnos is a portfolio project for [ALX-Africa Group](https://www.alxafrica.com/) in conjunction with [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/). Being a rabbit enthusiast from Oyo State, Nigeria, I have grown fond of rabbits as pets and meat consumption. People think rabbit to be an expensive animal to consume or cater for while neglicting the various advantages they provide being an animal with white meat.
As a Rabbit farmer for more than 5 years experience, Rabbits are generally one of the easiest animal to breed, ranging from feed consumption, mating, wastes(which can be used for fertizer and manure).
This website is designed to make buying and selling of Rabbits easy in my locale and to serve as awareness to the populace such an advantageous species are not expensive to venture into.
A Kanban board on Trello was utilized throughout in order to keep tasks and communication organized. The front end and the way the pages routing was designed, allowed Bunnos to have more dynamic features without handcuffing the rest of the project. Python Framework(FLASK) allowed the frontend to interact with the backend in a simple and well documented way. We decided to use Flask-SQLALchemy, Jinja 2 templating and  sqlite3 because of modularity and familiarity
